# get_next_line  

## Why do I think get_next_line is the most beautiful project at 42 School?  

Truth be told, it could just as easily be the ugliest.  
I started this project five times. I even had two working versions at one point, but I kept feeling that my code was clunky and overly complicated. It wasnâ€™t until the sixth attemptâ€”when I was preparing for the examâ€”that I finally managed to create clean and readable code that I am truly proud of.

## How does the function work?  

The purpose of `get_next_line` is to read the next line from an open file. It accomplishes this with the help of a buffer that can be of any size (e.g., 5 bytesâ€”it works equally well with buffers of size 1 or 1000 bytes).  

The buffer is a **static variable**, meaning that every time the function is called, it "remembers" the data stored in it from the previous call.  

### Step-by-step explanation:  
1. Each time the function is called, additional bytes are read from the file into the buffer.  
2. These bytes are copied into the `line` variable.  
3. This process continues until either a newline character (`\n`) or the end of the file is encountered.  
4. The completed line is then returned as the functionâ€™s result.

## What makes it special?  

For me, this project was a journey of persistence and refinement. It taught me the importance of revisiting and improving code, as well as the value of simplicity and clarity in programming.  

I'm proud of the result and excited to share this implementation. ðŸ˜Š
